Title: Slam Jam 4 - Part 1
Date: 2025-03-5

I am going to try and blog my first Game Jam that I am going to **COMPLETE**. The game jam is [Slam Jam 4](https://itch.io/jam/slam-jam-4). This is a specifically aimed at South Australian developers. It is 10 days starting March 14th and culminates in my first SAGA event Playback!

I have essentially completed the game I made for the 20 sec game jam but I never got around to polishing it. If the 20 sec game jam comes around again, I will endeavor to actually get it finished and uploaded. But for now it goes into the _WIP_ column.

I think the biggest issue for myself will be art. I am going to try and be as least artsy as I can and work more toward stylisation. If the game has cool effects and gameplay I feel like I can sort of dodge the idea of really good art.
