Title: Advent of Code 2025
Date: 2025-11-30

## Advent of Code is here!

I am excited to be doing Advent of Code with a couple of mates. I am still tossing up between PowerShell, Python, or Golang. I feel like I will probably start with Python and possibly move toward one of the others during the week and a half. I got side tracked last year doing it so keen to knuckle down and get it done this year.
